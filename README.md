## The project

The projet has been developed as part of the web developement training program at [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/en-GB).

The instruction was to develop a responsive showcase website for a fictional photographer in 4 days in order to consolidate and broaden our knowledge on HTML5 and CSS3 (and later on JavaScript vanilla).

* Blog page that display cards of articles 
* One full written article
* E-shop that displays sample products
* Contact page with a fake contact form

## Technologies

## Potential improvements

* Develop a real e-shop
